<h2 class="m-bottom-4">Tone</h2>

<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Approachable.</strong> We’re here to help.  We take complicated technical concepts and distill them down into plain english, without judgment or condescension.  We speak to our customer’s experience level because we value them.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Conversational.</strong> We aren’t overly-formal, contrived or corporate. We’re people first, marketers second. We never sound scripted or phony.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Fun &amp; irreverent.</strong> We are playful and don’t mind a little humor. We try to keep it PG-13, but no promises.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Authentic.</strong> We get straight to the point. We’re candid, don’t dance around touchy subjects, and are always real with people.</p>

<h2 class="m-bottom-4">Style</h2>

<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>People-Centric.</strong> There are real people working at DreamHost.  There’s real people using DreamHost.  We’ll never lose sight of that.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Playful.</strong> We’re fun! We feel positive, upbeat, and alive.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Relevant.</strong> We aren’t dated. We use modern best practices and aesthetics.</p>
<p class="m-bottom-4"><strong>Simple.</strong> We’re clean, not cluttered. Function over form. A goal is always clear and effortless to achieve.</p>
