			<p class="t-c-b700"><strong class="l-inline-block p-bottom-2">Empower People</strong><br />Because we don’t need any stuffy-white-shirted-tie-wearing boss micro-managing our every move, we have the autonomy to complete the projects that matter and make a difference for customers. We do all of that because we believe in giving customers the right tools they need to achieve their dreams online. By empowering our employees to be truly helpful, we also empower our customers with products and services they need to do their business, their way... and that’s what it’s all about!</p>

We’re a gaping hole from which truth oozes, white hot, and which ultimately brings us closer together. Being transparent with each other and with our customers is a surefire way to build trust, mutual respect, and, if we’ve had enough wine, love.</p>

			<p class="t-c-b700"><strong class="l-inline-block p-bottom-2">Embrace Open Source</strong><br />DreamHost understands the world is embracing open source technology. From our infrastructure, to our software stack, to our product management tools, we believe that open source products enable us to do great things for ourselves and, more importantly, our customers. Open source gives opportunities for growth, criticism and accountability. We not only leverage the work of others but contribute code back to larger projects that benefit all users - not just ourselves and our customers. That’s the beauty of the open source world.</p>

We’ve been known to bend into all sorts of uncomfortable positions to serve customers and our employees better!</p>

			<p class="t-c-b700"><strong class="l-inline-block p-bottom-2">Provide Superhero Service</strong><br />DreamHost strives to max out the value and customer service we put into everything we do (see Superhero Service). We hire authentically super people, not those faceless detached robots you get at other places, because we believe that empowered employees can make better decisions and deliver top shelf service. We cultivate employee development with significant investment to grow the knowledge base and skillset of our employees.</p>

			<p class="t-c-b700"><strong class="l-inline-block p-bottom-2">Be Irreverent &amp; Fun</strong><br />While we take our customers and the services we provide very seriously, we don’t take OURSELVES so seriously that dealing with us becomes an exercise in being PC. Life has “edges.” We tend to hangout around those edges in the way we do business, and that’s evident in the way we communicate. You are far more likely to encounter an off-the-wall, irreverent comment from us than you are to be subjected to corporate double-speak.</p>
